                <li>'Live & Die in Afrika'</li>
                <p> Live and Die in Afrika is Sauti Sol’s third studio album. The 15-track album is the group’s first self-produced album touted to have birthed the hit singles: Sura Yako, Isabella, Nishike, Shake Yo Bam Bam and Still the One. The album is a celebration of the African continent coming of age, flaunting the richness in cultural diversity , talent and resources. And now we finally have a generation that fully believes in this continent and her great potential.African diaspora is on a mission to reconnect with their roots, be it through music or other media. There is a willingness to aspire everything and anything African. “In California, they have been dancing to Sura Yako,” (Barack Obama). They sing and dance to the same tune at a wedding in Moshi, Tanzania. There is a willingness to Live and Die in Afrika. These are the united minds of Africa. Minds that will LIVE AND DIE IN AFRIKA!
